### 👋 Hello! 

I manage GitHub's Customer Reliability Engineering & Premium Support teams, partnering with our customers to help ensure that they're as successful as possible using GitHub!

I'm passionate about solving problems and playing around with new technologies. I dabble with home automation, enjoy long walks on the beach, and probably spend too much time cuddling with my puppy 🐶!

### 🔭 What do I use to work?

I primarily work with Ansible, Shell, Python, Ruby, and Terraform for home projects as well as tooling used across our teams at GitHub and our customers! Pretty much all of my work is either done in a web browser or in Vim 🤓

### 🌱 What am I learning?

Ongoing learnings with Ruby, Python, IaC/Automation (Terraform/Ansible)... and the never ending journey to have better dotfiles.
