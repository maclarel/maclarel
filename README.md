### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! 

I'm a Technical Support Account Manager (TSAM) at GitHub. My job is to help ensure that our customers are able to use GitHub as successfully as possible within their organization!

I'm passionate about solving problems and playing around with new technologies. I dabble with home automation, enjoy long walks on the beach, and spend far too much time on a command line...

### ðŸ”­ What do I use to work?

I primarily work with Bash, Ansible, Terraform, and dabble in some Python for home projects and to build out tooling used across our Support teams at GitHub!

My daily drivers are [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2), [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom), and of course a whole lot of [GitHub](https://github.com/).

### ðŸŒ± L & D 

Iâ€™m currently deep diving into Ruby on Rails, as well as working on a variety of infrastructure projects to become more fully versed in the IaaS/PaaS spaces.
