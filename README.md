### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! 

I currently work at GitHub ensuring the safety, reliability, and security of our platform and users.

I'm passionate about solving problems and ~learning~ breaking new technologies. When not bug hunting in OSS projects you can find me building/playing CTF challenges or lurking in the shadows at many security conferences across North America.
