### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! 

I'm a Technical Support Account Manager (TSAM) and I partner with our customers to help ensure that they're as successful as possible using GitHub!

I'm passionate about solving problems and playing around with new technologies. I dabble with home automation, enjoy long walks on the beach, and spend far too much time on a command line...

### ðŸ”­ What do I use to work?

I primarily work with Ansible, Bash, Python, Ruby, and Terraform for home projects as well as tooling used across our teams at GitHub and our customers!

### ðŸŒ± What am I learning?

Ongoing learnings with Ruby and IaC/Automation (Terraform/Ansible)... and the never ending journey to have a better `.vimrc`.
