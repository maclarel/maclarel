### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! 

I'm a Technical Support Account Manager (TSAM) and I partner with our customers to help ensure that they're as successful as possible using GitHub!

I'm passionate about solving problems and playing around with new technologies. I dabble with home automation, enjoy long walks on the beach, and spend far too much time on a command line...

### ðŸ”­ What do I use to work?

I primarily work with Bash, Ansible, Terraform, and dabble in some Python for home projects and to build out tooling used across our Support teams at GitHub!

My daily drivers are [iTerm2](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2), [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom), and of course a whole lot of [GitHub](https://github.com/).

### ðŸŒ± What am I learning?

Iâ€™m currently working on a variety of infrastructure projects to become more fully versed in the IaaS/PaaS spaces, as well as lots of home lab projects involving automation and containers!
