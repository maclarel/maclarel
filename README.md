### 👋 Hello! 

I'm a Technical Support Account Manager and I partner with our customers to help ensure that they're as successful as possible using GitHub! Don't let the position name fool you, I spend about 90% of my time at a command line building tooling, digging through logs, and troubleshooting applications at scale.

I'm passionate about solving problems and playing around with new technologies. I dabble with home automation, enjoy long walks on the beach, and probably spend too much time cuddling with my puppy 🐶!

### 🔭 What do I use to work?

I primarily work with Ansible, Bash, Python, Ruby, and Terraform for home projects as well as tooling used across our teams at GitHub and our customers! Pretty much all of my work is either done in a web brower or in Vim.

### 🌱 What am I learning?

Ongoing learnings with Ruby, Python, IaC/Automation (Terraform/Ansible)... and the never ending journey to have better dotfiles.
